## This is a Random Quote generator.

#### this is a simple version where quotes are rotated in a random order so they may often repeat
I have built two version of it one is from a free public api and so is used in the deployed version.
The another one is not free api so it needs backend to use prox and manage cors. so it is available in different branch.
### swith to zenApi branch and clone the project. That project uses a backend to act as a proxy server to fetch data from zenApi.
